    <h1>üê© Teacup Poodle</h1>
    <p>
      This variation on the standard poodle may be small, but the teacup poodle
      lacks none of the intelligence, loyalty, and alertness of the
      standard-sized poodle. Teacup poodles are affectionate, easy to train, and
      moderately energetic, making them the perfect fit for families who want a
      companion pup without seriously high exercise and maintenance needs.
      However, there are some other factors that you need to keep in mind when
      adopting this dog.
