    <h1>Information about Teacup Poodle üê©</h1>
    <h2>What Do Teacup Poodles Look Like?</h2>
    <p>
      Teacup poodles stand no more than 9 inches tall and weigh up to 6 pounds.
      They have round heads with a slight stop, much like standard-sized
      poodles, floppy ears, and a longer muzzle. Their eyes are typically small
      and dark, but very alert, and they will have a longer neck, square body,
      and straight back with long legs. The coat of the teacup poodle is
      thicker, curly, and soft and will need to be brushed often to prevent
      tangles. Colors of teacup poodles include blue, black, brown, gray,
      silver, red, beige, white, caf√©, and apricot, and your teacup poodle may
      have a sable or phantom pattern, but solid colors are the most common for
      this breed‚Äôs coat.
    </p>
    <h2>Are Teacup Poodles Good With Other Animals?</h2>
    <p>
      Teacup poodles are generally good with other animals as they are a
      friendly and social pup. However, large dogs may not make the best playing
      partners due to the risk of the smaller, more fragile teacup poodle
      getting injured or frightened by a larger animal‚Äôs playing methods.
    </p>
    <h2>Are Teacup Poodles Aggressive?</h2>
    <p>
      Teacup poodles are not known to be aggressive and don‚Äôt have a very high
      prey drive, unlike the standard-sized poodle. Your teacup poodle is
      unlikely to attack, nip, or act aggressively toward strangers, but they
      can develop these behaviors if they are very anxious, fearful, or bored.
      To prevent anxiety from displaying as aggression, you should make sure
      that your teacup poodle doesn‚Äôt spend a lot of time alone and has
      designated playtimes and time spent relaxing by your side.
    </p>
    <h2>Are Teacup Poodles Easy to Train?</h2>
    <p>
      Due to their higher intelligence, teacup poodles can be quite easy to
      train. They are loyal, affectionate, and eager to please their owners, all
      factors which help them pick up new skills quickly and learn basic
      obedience tasks. Your teacup poodle may even be up to the challenge of
      learning more advanced tricks depending on their intelligence and how
      quickly they learn.
    </p>
    <h2>Are Teacup Poodles Energetic?</h2>
    <p>
      Teacup poodles have a moderate energy level and are a very playful breed.
      This pup will need two short walks per day that last around 15 minutes
      each and are likely to expend a lot of energy running around their home
      and playing with their toys and their families.
